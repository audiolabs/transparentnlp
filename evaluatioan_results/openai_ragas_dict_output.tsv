No answer	"In some cases, your Alexa-enabled device might interpret another word or sound as the wake word (for instance, the name ""Alex"" or someone saying ""Alexa"" on the radio or television). When this happens, we call that a ""false wake."" We have a team of world-class scientists and engineers dedicated to continually improving our wake word detection technology and preventing false wakes from happening, including through the cloud verification mechanism described in the FAQ ""How does Alexa minimize the amount of data sent to the cloud?"" Anytime your Echo device detects the wake word, a visual or audible indicator will signal it is recording audio to stream to the cloud, and you can review and delete the voice recordings associated with your account (including any audio resulting from a false wake) in your Voice History available in the Alexa app and Echo Show devices at Settings > Alexa Privacy or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings."	Your device is only enabled if it detects the wake word. To ensure that Alexa is only recording if you want it to, we use two detection mechanisms and are continuously improving our technology. The visual and audible indicators on your device will show when the wake word was detected and audio is processed. You can manage and delete your voice recordings in the Alexa Privacy Settings in your Alexa App.	Your Alexa device is only enabled through the wake word.
