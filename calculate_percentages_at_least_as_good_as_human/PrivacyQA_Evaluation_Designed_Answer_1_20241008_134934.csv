Can I delete my old calendar history?,"Sure, you can tell Alexa to manage or delete any calendar event for you.","The response text is: ""Sure, you can tell Alexa to manage or delete any calendar event for you.""

The provided context is about using voice commands to manage calendar events with Alexa, including deletion of events. The given statement perfectly aligns with the context as it clearly mentions that one can tell Alexa to manage or delete calendar events. 

The response does not deviate from the context at all. It does not add any extra information that would be considered out of context. Therefore, the response is highly contextually adherent.

Therefore, the context adherence score is 100. 

Overall score: 100","The provided response does not fully cover the relevant information given in the context. The response correctly states that you can tell Alexa to manage or delete any calendar event, which aligns with the portion of the context about using voice commands with Alexa to manage your calendar.

However, the context also includes information about specific commands to delete events, namely ""Delete [event] from my calendar."" and ""Delete my [time/date] event."" These specific commands are not addressed in the response, leaving this information unaddressed.

The question specifically asks about deleting old calendar history, which could imply deleting multiple past events at once, or having Alexa manage deletion of events beyond just one-off incidents. This is not clarified or specified in the response. 

Also, the response does not specify whether Alexa can delete events that have already passed (which counts as old calendar history).

Considering these factors, while the response does contain some relevant information, it does not fully address the question or utilize all of the provided context.

Overall score: 50","The provided statement ""Sure, you can tell Alexa to manage or delete any calendar event for you.."" refers to Amazon's voice-controlled service Alexa's ability to handle and manipulate calendar-related tasks.

My reasoning around this statement's correctness would be based on the documented capabilities of Alexa, as portrayed by Amazon herself and known verified user experiences. Alexa does have the capabilities to interact with, manage and update calendar events when correctly integrated with a compatible calendar service. This includes creating, reading and even deleting events, provided the event is on a calendar Alexa has access to and the correct command is provided.

Based on this reasoning, the statement is factually accurate, as Alexa does have the ability to manage or delete any calendar event, assuming a correct setup is in place. So, the correctness score would be near the maximum.

Overall score: 98. The score isn't a full 100 because the functionality might depend on certain setups and integrations with compatible calendar services, which the statement did not specify.","The given answer is related to the question but not exactly, as the question asks about deleting old calendar history whereas the answer caters to the deletion of any calendar event with the help of Alexa.

1) Relevance to the topic: I would rate this as 75. The answer is related to the topic of managing calendar events, including deletion, though it doesn't specifically address deleting old calendar history.

2) Correctness of the information: The given answer is factually correct from the perspective of the functionality of Alexa. However, it doesn't address if ""old calendar history"" can all be deleted through Alexa. This would be a score of 60.

3) Completeness of the answer: Given that the question is about deleting old calendar history, the answer doesn't give a complete response since it does not highlight how or if this is possible. This is a score of 55.

4) Clarity of the answer: The answer is straightforward and easy to understand, portraying clear information about Alexa's capability, without responding to the specific aspect of ""old calendar history"". This would rate as 80.

To calculate the overall score, we average these four scores together.

Overall score: (75 + 60 + 55 + 80) / 4 = 67.5",100,2.3681007563963874,0.3529411764705882,0.8927752375602722,91.11,5th and 6th grade,1.0,14
Do I have choice or control options for my contacts' information?,"Once you have registered for Alexa Communication on your Alexa App, your contacts are auto-updated from your tablet or mobile phone. You can disable contact import to delete previously imported contacts from your device.","The text provided mainly discusses registration for Alexa Communication, importing of contacts from a device to the Alexa app, auto-updating of imported contacts, disabling of contact import, and deletion of contacts once import is disabled. These are all points that are also covered in the context given. Therefore, there's high context adherence.

However, the part in the text about how contacts can be manually added to the Alexa contact list or at https://alexa.amazon.com, and how each manually added contact can be deleted specifically by selecting the applicable contact card is absent. This means there's not 100% context adherence. 

Also, the sequence of points enumerated in the context isn't followed in the text verbatim, but this doesn't affect the context adherence, as information is conveyed comprehensively. 

Considering these parameters, I'd rate the context adherence at around 85. It's a high rate, but there's still room for including all details provided in the given context.

Overall score: 85","The response covers the most important information about how contacts are managed after registering for Alexa Communication on the Alexa app. It correctly explains that contacts are auto-updated from the user's mobile or tablet device, and it correctly explains the option to disable contact import, which would delete previously imported contacts from the device.

However, the response leaves out a couple of key details which were included in the context that would be relevant to the question about having choice or control options for the contacts' information. Specifically, it does not mention the option to manually add contacts to the Alexa contact list or the ability to delete individually added contacts by selecting the applicable contact card. These pieces of information would be relevant to a user who is seeking to learn about their options for managing their contacts' information in the Alexa app, and their omission reduces the completeness of the response.

Step by step reasoning:
- Covers auto-update of contacts detail: score 25
- Covers disabling import to delete contacts: score 25
- Leaves out manual addition of contacts: score -15
- Leaves out option to delete individual contacts: score -15

Overall Score: 20","The text in focus talks about managing contacts with Alexa Communication after registering with the Alexa App. 

To assess its correctness, we can break it into claims and evaluate each:

1. ""Once you have registered for Alexa Communication on your Alexa App, your contacts are auto-updated from your tablet or mobile phone"" - This statement is correct. After setting up Alexa Communication, the Alexa App does indeed sync and auto-update contacts from the user's mobile device. 

2. ""You can disable contact import to delete previously imported contacts from your device"" - This statement is slightly misleading. While the user can certainly disable contact import (stopping future updates), this action won't automatically delete previously imported contacts. 

Given that 1 statement is correct and the other is partially correct, I would give the second statement a lower correctness score due to the misunderstanding it might create. 

With this in mind, assuming a 100 for the first point and perhaps a 60 for the second, I would provide an Overall score: 80.","The question asks about the control options for contacts' information, and the answer addresses the fact that contacts are auto-updated once registered for Alexa Communication, with the option to disable contact import, thus deleting previously imported contacts. 

The answer is directly addressing the query about control options for contact's information. It points out that the user has control over the import of contacts, the capability to disable this feature, and the potential to delete previously imported contacts.

However, the answer could provide a bit more detail, such as a step-by-step guide to disable the contact import, ensuring optimal user control, or more broadly about other potential control options that Alexa might offer. While the answer given is relevant, it doesn't completely cover all potential aspects of user control over contacts' information.

Can I hide my email address?,"We collect your email for Amazon services. However, You can edit or update your email address from your account.","The context talks about accessing various types of information including name, address, payment options, etc. from the ""Your Account"" section of the website, albeit it does not specifically mention the email addresses. However, the given text talks about collecting email for Amazon services and updating the email address which is not entirely out of context but does not adhere 100% to the given context. The text mainly adds new information about email collection and editing that is not directly stated in the context, but it is along the lines of managing and accessing personal information in an online account setting. 

So, there is some degree of context adherence, primarily because it still pertains to user account information just like the context, even though it mainly adds new details. This reasoning suggests a score somewhat above average but not too high.

Overall score: 60","The response mentions collection of the email for Amazon services and the possibility to edit or update the email address from your account. However, the question asked was whether or not one can hide the email address which is not addressed in the response. Moreover, the response only slightly touches the context, discussing the possibility of editing/updating the email but not the full range of information accessible from the ""Your Account"" section which includes name, address, payment options, profile information, Prime membership, household settings, and purchase history. 

Therefore, the completeness of the answer is quite low. It covers a bit of the context and indirectly relates to the question but does not fully answer it. Neither does it engage with the full range of information presented in the context. 

Overall score: 20.","The text ""We collect your email for Amazon services. However, You can edit or update your email address from your account."" appears to be factual and accurate. Amazon does indeed collect email addresses for its services, and it's correct that users can edit their email address from their account settings.

However, as an AI, I cannot confirm the current exact methods and practices of Amazon. Therefore, this evaluation is based on general practices of similar service providers.

In order to maintain strict fact-checking, it could be wise to always refer directly to Amazon's policies or guidance for most accurate information. As an assistant, I don't have real-time access to all online systems and their most recent practices.

Overall score: 85","The question is asking about the possibility of hiding one's email address, which could be related to issues of privacy or spam prevention. The response given, however, discusses the ability to edit or update the email address in an Amazon account. While this is related to handling one's email on an online platform, it does not specifically address the question's concern about hiding the email address.

Since we are looking for relevance we can see a slight connection as the both deal with managing an email on a online platform. The user might be left wondering after reading the given answer, since it doesn't fully provide what they asked for. 

However, mentioning the process of altering the email could imply that if you could also hide it, they would have mentioned that. Hence, an experienced user might infer that hiding is not possible.

Therefore, the relevancy is not high, still it is not completely irrelevant. Let's consider the connection made here, although slight, and rate it 25.

I want to change my name.,Visit the Alexa Profile Settings on your Alexa App to edit information on your name.,"The context given talks about updating information on certain pages as mentioned in the ""Information You Can Access"" section and about maintaining a copy of the previous information. However, the response discusses visiting the Alexa Profile Settings on the Alexa App to edit the name information. There is a slight connection as they both involve updating information, but there isn't specific relevance because the context does not give any indication about an Alexa App or about editing name information.

On the basis of this, the response shows low context adherence. There is a general similarity in topic (updating information), but the response is not directly addressing the provided context.

Therefore, the context adherence can be roughly estimated around 30 out of 100. This is because a topic relation exists, but the response contains specific details that are not present in the provided context.

Overall score: 30","The information provided in the response does clearly meet the question's need, as it gives detailed instruction on how the user can change their name: by visiting the Alexa Profile Settings on the Alexa App. 

However, the response does not directly tie into the context provided. The context seems to hint towards general rules for updating information and the potential for old data retention, but these aren't addressed in the response. This leaves some relevant information out of the response, meaning it can't achieve a score of 100.

Additionally, the response doesn't clarify if the changes would be saved, a point referred to in the context. The context also references an 'Information You Can Access' section which isn't addressed in the response. 

Considering these points, although the response addresses the question, it doesn't thoroughly cover all the relevant information available in the context. 

Overall score: 70.","The provided text is a guideline on how to edit information on your Alexa App. To evaluate the correctness of this statement, we need to verify if Alexa Profile Settings are indeed found on the Alexa App and if they allow for the editing of personal information.

Research indicates that the Alexa App does indeed provide options like changing your name, location, temperature scale, etc, in the settings section. Therefore, it can be considered correct.

However, the specific term ""Alexa Profile Settings"" might not accurately represent the nuanced steps needed to make these changes. The app has ""Settings"" where you can edit your information but may not have a direct category called ""Alexa Profile Settings"". Therefore, the correctness is not absolute.

Considering these points, while generally, the information is correct, the slight inaccuracies in representation lead to a little deduction.

Overall score: 90.","Firstly, the user's question is open-ended: ""I want to change my name."" Therefore, the context isn't clear. The user could be referring to a legal name change, social media profile, or as mentioned in the answer, their name on an Alexa device. 

Given this, the assistant provides an answer that is relevant if the user wanted to change the name on their Alexa device profile. However, it completely misses other contexts. 

Given that the answer could be entirely relevant or irrelevant depends hugely on the user's intent. Therefore, the relevancy score should be somewhere in the middle.

I want to edit my phone number.,If you have provided a phone number you can edit this in your Amazon Account Settings.,"The statement about the phone number being editable in Amazon Account Settings is quite related to the context provided. However, there is one contextual discrepancy in that the provided context does not specific mention the ability to edit or access phone numbers. It talks about accessing various types of information including name, address, payment options, profile information, prime membership, etc, but fails to go into specifics about the phone numbers.

The statement does adhere to the overall context in terms of accessing and changing account settings on Amazon. However, it is not perfectly adhering with the given specific context due to the lack of direct reference to phone number editing. 

Overall score: 80","The response contains relevant information regarding how to edit a phone number in the Amazon Account Settings, which directly addresses the user's question about adjusting their phone number, demonstrating a good level of completeness.

However, it does not provide complete information that exists in the context provided. The context gives a much broader overview of what all the information and settings the user can access and modify in the ""Your Account"" section, including name, address, payment options, profile information, Prime membership, household settings, and purchase history, along with the phone number. This broader context is not captured in the response. There is also no mention of going to the ""Your Account"" section as given in the context, which might be useful for a user who is not familiar with the Amazon website interface.

Hence, although the response addresses the specific question of modifying the phone number, it lacks complete context and full thoroughness. On a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being perfect completeness and 0 being no completeness, considering the specific question regarding editing the phone number and the broader context given.

Overall score: 70.","The provided text states, ""If you have provided a phone number you can edit this in your Amazon Account Settings.""

Analyzing this, we find that the statement is factual based on how Amazon operates. Users with active accounts on Amazon do have the ability to edit their personal details, such as phone number, in their account settings.

By considering that there are no observable inaccuracies or factual errors in the sentence's content, the correctness score for this statement is high. However, note that services or platforms might update their user interface or processes over time, which could potentially affect this statement's correctness in the future.

Based on the analysis, the statement appears to be correct as per the current context. Hence, the Correctness score is 100 as it perfectly matches the fact.

Overall score: 100","The question is looking for information on how to edit a phone number, potentially on a digital platform or website but doesn't expressly specify where. The answer given provides more accurate information assuming the user is referring to editing their phone number in Amazon account settings. 

The specificity of the platform makes the answer less universally relevant, but if the user refers to Amazon, it’s almost a perfect answer. As such, if the user was speaking about Amazon, we'd rate the answer high, but we have to consider that the user didn't specify.

Given these factors, we would say that the answer's relevance is potentially extremely high, but there's uncertainty which needs to be considered because the platform wasn't specified in the question.

Can you delete information about my time zone?,Your time zone can be a result of your current location settings and is used to personalize your experience. You can change your device's location at any time by selecting your device's location on your Alexa App.,"The first part of the response text discusses the user's time zone being affected by their location settings and how it can be changed on the Alexa App. This is somewhat related to the context as it is also discussing changing settings on devices and mentions device's location. However, it does not specifically mention anything about opt-out options or processing data, which the context heavily focuses on.

The second part of the response is not contextually adherent at all. The context does not mention anything about Amazon or non-Amazon devices, their permissions, or accessing location services. The context also doesn't mention a ""Manage Your Content and Devices"" or settings menu which the response suggests. 

Overall, the first part of the text can be considered moderately context adherent, possibly a score around 50, as it does discuss location settings, albeit on a different device. However, the second part of the text is not adherent to the context, warranting a score closer to 0.

Overall score: 25","The response covers the details about how the time zone is set, based on the user's current location settings and how it can be modified using the Alexa App. While these details do provide some useful information, they do not completely answer the user's question on whether they can delete the time zone data.

In context, Amazon has been highlighted as having options to opt out certain types of data handling by navigating through settings on the respective devices or applications. There is no mention specifically about deleting time zone information, which is what the question requests. This feature is important to the user question as it directly refers to deleting specific data. The model touches on modifying location permissions but does not go as far as explaining whether this erases the stored information.

The response does not fully adhere to the contents of the context when considering the user question about deleting their time zone data. It does not provide any clear or direct answer to the query about the possibility of such action. Based on these conditions, the response isn't entirely complete.

Overall score: 40. This score represents the partial information the response provides on interacting with location settings but is significantly reduced because of the lack of direct relevance to the question at hand.","The text claims that ""Your time zone can be a result of your current location settings and is used to personalize your experience."" This statement is correct because most digital devices adapt to the time zone of the location they are set to, thus personalizing the experience for the user.

It also says: ""You can change your device's location at any time by selecting your device's location on your Alexa App."" The correctness of this statement depends on the device and the app in question. In the case of the Alexa App mentioned in the statement, this is factually correct because Alexa does allow changing your device's location settings in the App.

Reasoning: The text provided two claims, both of which are factually correct when applied to the appropriate context and device.

The first claim is universally correct for all devices that have location settings, while the second claim is specific to devices with the Alexa App installed.

Considering the overall correctness of the combined statements and their general applicability, the average amount of correctness does not need to be adjusted, as none of the claims were incorrect or misleading.

Overall score: 100","The question asks about the possibility of deleting time zone information. The response, while it includes information about the impact of time zone settings and how to change those settings, does not directly address whether this information can be deleted. However, by explaining how to change the device's location, the response implies that it is not possible to completely remove time zone information as it is inherent to the device's location setting. 

In terms of relevancy, the response is loosely connected to the question but isn't a direct answer to what was asked. It talks about changing the device's location, which may impact the time zone settings indirectly, but doesn't address deleting the information. The response might be more valuable to someone who is unhappy with his current time zone settings instead of someone who wants to delete this information entirely. 

As a result, while there is some relevance, it's not a very strong match.

Can you delete my voice recordings?,"You can delete your voice recordings -one by one, by date range, with an Alexa-enabled device, using attributed voice ID, or all at once by visiting Alexa privacy in your settings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your requests.","The text response clearly adheres to the context originally given, as it presents the same topic: deleting voice recordings on Alexa-enabled devices. Both the context and the response discuss the different ways to delete voice recordings: one by one, by date, and for all records at once through the Alexa Privacy settings.

The response also adds valuable details about deleting voice recordings by declining to save voice recordings at all, which is correctly derived from the original context.

However, the response does not mention deleting voice data via vocal commands, such as ""Alexa, delete what I just said,"" or deleting voice data via Manage Your Content and Devices. Moreover, there is no mention of the ability to set up automatic deletion of recordings older than 3 or 18 months, which is stated in the original context.

This shows that while the response aligns significantly with the context, it does not completely cover every key point made in the original context, resulting in a minor loss of context adherence.

Considering the above reasoning, I would give this response a score of 85 out of 100 for context adherence, as it generally follows the context quite well but omits a few key points.

Overall score: 85.","The given response misses some important pieces of information provided in the context. For instance, it doesn't mention that the user can choose to have voice recordings older than 3 or 18 months deleted automatically. It also omits that the user can delete all those voice recordings associated with their account all at once for each of their Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and Devices. In addition, the response doesn't convey the information that the user can also enable the ability to delete the recordings just by using their voice. The specific voice commands that can be used for deleting the voice recordings (""Alexa, delete what I just said,"" ""Alexa, delete everything I said today,"" ""Alexa, delete everything I said."") are not covered in the response. Also, the response does not refer to the user’s ability to prompt an update to their privacy settings or auto-deletion of their voice recordings via voice (""Alexa, update my privacy settings,"" or ""Alexa, auto-delete my voice recordings"").

Overall score: 50","The text appears to be discussing options for deleting voice recordings from an Alexa-enabled device. 

1. ""You can delete your voice recordings -one by one, by date range, with an Alexa-enabled device, using attributed voice ID."" - This information is factual. Amazon does provide multiple ways to manage and delete your voice recordings through Alexa's settings. Correctness: 100/100.

2. ""Or all at once by visiting Alexa privacy in your settings."" - This information about being able to delete all at once by visiting the Alexa privacy settings also checks out and is correct. Correctness: 100/100.

3. ""If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your requests."" - This is factual as well. Amazon indeed has a feature which, if enabled, automatically deletes voice recordings after they have been processed. Correctness: 100/100.

Therefore, the statement is completely correct according to the information provided by Amazon about its voice recordings and privacy settings.

Overall score: 100.","The question asks, ""Can you delete my voice recordings?"" and the answer provided gives a detailed explanation on how voice recordings can be deleted. This indicates a strong relevance as the answer directly addresses the question, providing several options for deletion. 

However, the answer also assumes that 'you' refers to the user themselves, not the assistant. The asking party could have meant for the assistant to delete the recordings on their behalf. This could slightly decrease the relevancy but the primary focus - deleting voice recordings - is still accurately addressed.

The answer goes beyond the question by providing the information about the automatic deletion of voice recordings if the user chooses not to save any. Though unsolicited, this information is highly pertinent and could be appreciated by the user for its helpfulness. 

Considering these factors, I would rate the relevancy high, though not perfect due to the potential confusion around whether 'you' refers to the user or the assistant.

Are you sharing my age with others?,"By default, we do not share your information with anyone. However, you can grant sharing permissions through your Settings under Alexa privacy.","Looking at the context and the response text, one can say that both details concern privacy settings and sharing of personal information. But when we look closer, we see some differences.

1. The context talks about a specific type of sharing, with skill developers, and explains the nature of this sharing in detail. The response text, while mentioning sharing settings, does not specifically talk about sharing with skill developers. Therefore, we can deduct some points for this.

2. The 'settings under Alexa privacy' mentioned in the response text aligns with the context  which is about the Alexa Privacy settings. This should provide some score for context adherence.

3. The context mentions the user granting permissions to share specific details such as name and email address, while the response text just generally speaks about granting sharing permissions without specifying what information this regards. This again is a slight disconnect between the centered context and the generic response, which should cause a score deduction.

As a result of the slight gaps in alignment,  the context adherence isn't perfect but it's not totally off either.

Overall score: 70.","The text partially answers the question and addresses the context by mentioning the default status of not sharing information and the process of granting permissions through settings. However, it does not address the specific issue of whether the user's age is shared with others or not, which was directly asked in the question, and it doesn't address the sharing with skill developers. 

In terms of the original context, the response fails to mention anything about how the user can manage which specific additional information they have granted skill developers access to. It also doesn't reference the specific mechanisms for adjusting privacy settings, such as the website.

That said, the response does correctly identify that it is the user who has control over what information is shared by modifying their settings, which is a key point in relation to the context.

Having analysed the text, I provide the following overall completeness score:

Overall score: 50. This is because it generally addresses the theme of privacy and control thereof, but it fails to address specific details asked in the question and provided in the context. It only vaguely mirrors the information in the context as well as the specific question about age sharing.","The given text appears to be discussing privacy settings in relation to a service, which appears to be Alexa by the context. To evaluate its correctness, we need to verify whether, by default, the service does not share user information, and whether users can grant sharing permissions via their settings under Alexa privacy.

Amazon Alexa is known for prioritizing user privacy, and information sharing is not the default setting. In line with this, the statement ""By default, we do not share your information with anyone"" appears to be correct. 

The text also states, ""However, you can grant sharing permissions through your Settings under Alexa privacy"". This information is also correct as Amazon Alexa provides users the liberty to adjust their privacy settings, including sharing permissions.

Therefore, considering these pieces of information, the text seems accurate based on the context. There are no obvious factual errors or incorrect bits of information.

Hence, the correctness can be evaluated as a maximum possible score. So, the final evaluation would be:

Overall score: 100.","The question is asking specifically about the sharing of a user's age, a specific piece of personal data. The answer from the assistant explains that by default, no information is shared and that one can modify permissions on Alexa's privacy settings.

Relevancy:
1. The answer refers to the control of sharing information which is related to the topic in the question. It provides an overall perspective on privacy settings related to sharing any information. Score: 90
2. However, the answer does not specifically address 'age' which was the direct concern expressed in the question. This makes it less relevant because it doesn't directly answer the user's actual question. Score: 60

Who can access information about my appointments?,"Calendars are no longer shared between adults in your Amazon households. You can ask Alexa to switch to your account to check your calendar. However, content from your calendar might be available to anyone using your Alexa devices.","The text provided adheres to the context substantially. The context outlines how calendar accounts are linked and shared among Amazon households. It explains that a copy of the calendar is stored in the cloud for access via Alexa. It also warns that content from the calendar could be available to anyone using the given Alexa devices. Furthermore, it is stated that calendars will no longer be shared among adults in the Amazon household and that to hear events from other calendars, one has to ask Alexa to switch accounts, or link them through the Alexa app.

In the provided text, everything aligns perfectly with the context. The text talks about how calendars are no longer shared between adults in Amazon households and that one can ask Alexa to switch accounts to check a different calendar. It too warns that content from the calendar may be available to anyone who uses your Alexa devices. The text is a slightly reworded version of the context, making it perfectly in line with it.

Overall score: 100","The response captures the main point from the context that your calendar data is available to anyone using your Alexa devices, and it also explains that you can switch accounts in order to check your own calendar. However, the response does not mention that the user can also link calendars to other accounts in their Amazon Household by using the Alexa app, which is an important part of the context. It also doesn't clearly communicate that a copy of the user's calendar is stored in the cloud, which is crucial information in understanding where the data is being saved and thus who can access it. 

Overall, this response captures most of the information regarding who can access the user's calendar information, which is the question proposed. Yet, it does fail to capture all details relevant to the question, most notably the fact that the calendar can be linked to other accounts in the Amazon Household.

Overall score: 75","The text states two points in terms of functionality related to Amazon Alexa devices:

1. ""Calendars are no longer shared between adults in your Amazon households."" 
2. ""You can ask Alexa to switch to your account to check your calendar. However, content from your calendar might be available to anyone using your Alexa devices.""

I have found a mix of correctness and incorrectness in the given statement.

Point 1: Looking at Amazon's Alexa policies as of my knowledge, they do allow calendar sharing between adults in Amazon households. This negates the claim made in the given text, which mentions that sharing is no longer allowed. Therefore, the correctness of this part of the statement is 0.

Point 2: The second part of the statement is correct as per Amazon's guidelines and functionality of Alexa. Amazon Alexa does allow users to switch accounts and check their own calendars. Besides, it's factual that Alexa devices, when used collectively, might expose an individual's calendar events to others. Therefore, the correctness of this part of the text is 100.

After analyzing both points, the average score of correctness for the entire text is calculated by summing up the correctness of each individual (0 for the first and 100 for the second) and dividing it by the total number of points (2). 

Overall score: (0+100)/2 = 50.","The answer given is quite relevant to the question asked. The user is concerned about who can access the information about their appointments. The assistant provides that information indicating that calendar data isn't shared between adults in an Amazon household, but anyone using the user's Alexa devices might be able to access it. This is certainly crucial data for the user. However, this answer does not cover all possible ways someone could access an individual’s appointments (such as through shared online calendars, physical access to a device, etc.), so the answer is not completely comprehensive.

The assistant's answer specifically covers information as it pertains to Amazon and Alexa devices, while the question was posed in a more general sense. Therefore, it is relevant but not fully exhaustive.

Does the company share user's contacts' information with a third party?,We are not selling your personal information to others but might share it under certain circumstances such as when you're enabling third-party skills through our Alexa services. You will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.,"Step 1: The context provided by Amazon Europe states that customer's personal information is not sold to others, identical to the statement in the evaluated text. This shows high context adherence.
Step 2: The evaluated text talks about sharing information under certain circumstances such as through third party Alexa services. The context provided talks about sharing customer's personal information with Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Although the context does not specifically mention Alexa services, it does allow for sharing under described conditions which inherently implies that there could be other circumstances (possibly Alexa services) under which information might be shared. This suggests moderately high context adherence.
Step 3: The evaluated text provides information about customer's right to know when their data might be shared and ability to opt out. This is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, considering it's part of standard data privacy norms similar to those described in the context, it can be deemed to have a fair context adherence.

By considering the above mentioned points,

Overall score: 80","The response covers some substantial information present in the provided context. It does state that the company does not sell users' personal information, but might share it under some circumstances. It explicitly mentions one of these circumstances, namely, when a user enables third-party skills via the company's Alexa service. These points align with the information in the provided context, which states that user information is not sold, but may be shared under certain conditions, and that Amazon and its subsidiaries are bound by the restrictions of this privacy policy.

However, the response does not mention that personal information could be shared with Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Furthermore, the response does not directly answer the specific question asked: ""Does the company share user's contacts' information with a third party?"".

In terms of completeness, although the response covers a part of the information within the context, it fails to mention specific key details from the context and does not directly address the user's question. 

Overall score: 60.","The text mostly contains information that presents a hypothetical situation regarding the data privacy policy of an unspecified entity. However, it's difficult to evaluate the correctness of a hypothetical or generalized protocol without specification or context. Also, it's important to note that the text doesn't mention any facts that can be independently verified without knowing the specific entity it pertains to.

For instance, it refers to ""our Alexa services"", implying that it's about the policies of a company that provides such services - likely Amazon. If this is the case, the general policy might be accurate as most companies do reserve the right to share users' data under specific circumstances (as per their privacy policy), and usually offer users a chance to opt out. Amazon does, indeed, share information with third parties in some circumstances according to their privacy policy.

Some factors can affect the correctness score, such as the missing exactness of the entity it is referring to and the potential inaccuracy of policies, as data sharing policies vary between companies and even between different services provided by the same company.

Due to the lack of concrete, independent facts and the presence of unverifiable conditions, there is a considerable level of uncertainty in this text, hence the correctness cannot be definitively determined.

Overall score: NA","The answer provides details on how personal data might be shared with third parties under certain circumstances such as when third-party skills are enabled on Alexa services. However, this does not directly address the specific question about the sharing of a user's contacts' information with a third party.

The relevance of the answer to the question is therefore mixed. The answer does discuss the topic of information sharing with third parties, which is related to the user's query, giving the answer some relevance. However, it does not directly answer the user's question about the sharing of contact information.

Taking into account this reasoning, an evaluation of its relevancy would approximate at around 60 out of 100. It might vary a bit higher or lower based on individual interpretation of the specifics of personal information sharing stated in the answer compared to the specificity of the user's question about contact information.
