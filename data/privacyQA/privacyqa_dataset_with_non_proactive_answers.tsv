How do you process my audio recordings?	For help with this question go to the help and feedback section on the Alexa App.	"Alexa and Echo devices are designed to record as little audio as possible and minimize the amount of background noise streamed to the cloud. By default, Alexa-enabled devices only stream audio to the cloud if the wake word is detected (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). When an Alexa-enabled device detects the wake word and begins streaming audio to the cloud, Alexa performs a ""cloud verification"" of the wake word using the more powerful processing capabilities of the cloud to double-check the audio to confirm detection of the wake word. If the cloud verification does not also detect the wake word, Alexa stops processing the audio and ends the audio stream to the cloud. If Alexa confirms that the wake word was spoken, Alexa will continually attempt to determine when your request has ended and then immediately end the audio stream."	Our systems are designed to record as little audio as possible. Therefore, we only stream to the cloud if the wake word was detected and minimize the amount of background noise in the recording. We verify the wake word detection in the cloud and only if confirmed, continue processing.	Our Alexa and Echo devices are to record as little audio as possible and minimize the amount of background noise streamed to the cloud if a wake word is detected.			
Does the assistant turn on my mic without my knowledge?	No answer	"In some cases, your Alexa-enabled device might interpret another word or sound as the wake word (for instance, the name ""Alex"" or someone saying ""Alexa"" on the radio or television). When this happens, we call that a ""false wake."" We have a team of world-class scientists and engineers dedicated to continually improving our wake word detection technology and preventing false wakes from happening, including through the cloud verification mechanism described in the FAQ ""How does Alexa minimize the amount of data sent to the cloud?"" Anytime your Echo device detects the wake word, a visual or audible indicator will signal it is recording audio to stream to the cloud, and you can review and delete the voice recordings associated with your account (including any audio resulting from a false wake) in your Voice History available in the Alexa app and Echo Show devices at Settings > Alexa Privacy or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings."	Your device is only enabled if it detects the wake word. To ensure that Alexa is only recording if you want it to, we use two detection mechanisms and are continuously improving our technology. The visual and audible indicators on your device will show when the wake word was detected and audio is processed. You can manage and delete your voice recordings in the Alexa Privacy Settings in your Alexa App.	Your Alexa device is only enabled through the wake word. Anytime your Echo device detects the wake word, a visual or audible indicator will signal it is recording audio to stream to the cloud, and you can review and delete the voice recordings associated with your account.			
Why do you record my voice?	Your data allows me to respond to you and helps me learn from our interactions so that I can better help you. For example the more variation in spoken language I learn from, the better I'll be at understanding what you mean. You can find settings for how your data is used by visiting amazon.co.uk/alexaprivacysettings or the Privacy Section of the Alexa app.	"Alexa uses your voice recordings and other information, including from third-party services, to answer your questions, fulfill your requests, and improve your experience and our services. We associate your requests with your Amazon account to allow you to review your voice recordings, access other Amazon services (e.g. so you can ask Alexa to read your Kindle books and play audiobooks from Audible), and to provide you with a more personalized experience. For example, keeping track of the songs you have listened to helps Alexa choose what songs to play when you say, ""Alexa, play music."" At times, Alexa can provide you with recommendations based on your requests. For example, Alexa may recommend Alexa skills you might like based on the Alexa skills you use."

Do you store my voice recordings locally or on a server?	No answer	On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud. A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if you enable Alexa Guard, including for Smart Alerts and emergency calling with Guard Plus. See the Alexa Communication FAQs and the FAQs How does voice ID work?, How does Alexa Guard work?, and Can I review and delete my Alexa Guard audio recordings? for more information. If you turn this setting on, certain features like Live Translations, Dynamic Language Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to English (United States). If you change your device language to anything other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send Voice Recordings.

You can choose to not send voice recordings but only text transcripts of your request to the cloud.
