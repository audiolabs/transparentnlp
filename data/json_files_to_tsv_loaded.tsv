Can I delete my old calendar history?	privacy-FAQ-5	Privacy FAQ	"Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you
choose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.

If you have changed your default marketplace while using an
Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings
associated with your account separately for each marketplace. To learn

Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >

If your calendar history is stored as voice recordings, you might be able to delete it by selecting and deleting the corresponding voice recordings. For more specific information about managing your calendar, you may want to check the Alexa app or Amazon's help center."	"You are an assistant who answers questions about data protection.

Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you
choose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.

If you have changed your default marketplace while using an
Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings
associated with your account separately for each marketplace. To learn
how to transfer your Amazon account to another marketplace, go here

Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >
Device Settings in the Alexa app.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers.

When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Do I have choice or control options for my contacts' information?

Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Do I have choice or control options for my contacts' information?
Assistant: Yes, you can manage your contacts in the ""Your Account"" section of the website. You can add, update, or delete contacts. If you don't want Alexa to call or message your contacts, you can disable the feature in the Alexa app.

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Can I hide my email address?
Assistant: You can manage your email address and other contact information in the ""Your Account"" section of the website. However, you cannot hide it completely as it is required for certain features and services, such as receiving order confirmations and communication from Amazon.

Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >
Device Settings in the Alexa app.

Contacts, Notices & Revisions

If you have any concern about privacy at Amazon Europe or want to
contact one of our data controllers, please contact us
<https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/aw/contact-us> with a thorough
description and we will try to resolve the issue for you. Further, the
data protection officer for the above mentioned data controllers can be
contacted at *eu-privacy@amazon.de*. You can file a complaint with our
principal supervisory authority, the Commission Nationale pour la
Protection des Données in Luxemburg <https://cnpd.public.lu/de.html>, or
with a local authority.

Our business changes constantly and our Privacy Notice will change also.
You should check our website frequently to see recent changes. Unless
stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information
that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we
make, however, and will never materially change our policies and
practices to make them less protective of customer information collected
in the past without the consent of affected customers.

Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you
choose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.

If you have changed your default marketplace while using an
Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings
associated with your account separately for each marketplace. To learn
how to transfer your Amazon account to another marketplace, go here

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: I want to change my name.
Assistant: To change your name, you need to update your account information. You can do this by logging into your Amazon account and visiting the ""Your Account"" section. From there, you can edit your personal information, including your name. Keep in mind that changing your name may affect your voice ID, and you may need to retrain Alexa to recognize your new name.

Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you
choose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.

If you have changed your default marketplace while using an
Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings
associated with your account separately for each marketplace. To learn
how to transfer your Amazon account to another marketplace, go here

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: I want to change my name.
Assistant: To change your name, you need to update your account information. You can do this by logging into your Amazon account and visiting the ""Your Account"" section. From there, you can edit your personal information, including your name. Keep in mind that changing your name may affect your voice ID, and you may need to retrain Alexa to recognize your new name.

### Source 2 ###
Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you

If you have changed your default marketplace while using an

delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you
choose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.

If you have changed your default marketplace while using an
Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings
associated with your account separately for each marketplace. To learn

Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >
Device Settings in the Alexa app.

Can you delete information about my time zone?
Assistant: I'm unable to directly answer that question from the provided sources. However, the sources do mention that you can review and delete voice recordings associated with your account, which includes voice commands given to Alexa. While I can't confirm if time zone information is included in those voice recordings, you may want to check the voice history to see if deleting the recordings would also remove the time zone information. If you have any specific information about where the time zone data is stored or how it's linked to your account, please provide that and I'll do my best to help."	"You are an assistant who answers questions about data protection. Only the following knowledge is available for answering:

### Source 1 ###
Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you
choose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.

If you have changed your default marketplace while using an
Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings
associated with your account separately for each marketplace. To learn
how to transfer your Amazon account to another marketplace, go here

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >
Device Settings in the Alexa app.

Can you delete information about my time zone?
Assistant: I'm unable to directly answer that question from the provided sources. However, the sources do mention that you can review and delete voice recordings associated with your account, which includes voice commands given to Alexa. While I can't confirm if time zone information is included in those voice recordings, you may want to check the voice history to see if deleting the recordings would also remove the time zone information. If you have any specific information about where the time zone data is stored or how it's linked to your account, please provide that and I'll do my best to help."

Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you
choose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.

If you have changed your default marketplace while using an
Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings
associated with your account separately for each marketplace. To learn
how to transfer your Amazon account to another marketplace, go here

Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >
Device Settings in the Alexa app.

How do my voice recordings and text transcripts improve Alexa?*

Alexa is designed to get smarter every day. For example, we use your
requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language
understanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real
world requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa
to respond properly to the variation in our customers’ speech patterns,
dialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where
customers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine
learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely
small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct
interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the
future. For example, a human reviewing a customer’s request for the
weather in Austin can identify that Alexa misinterpreted it as a request
for the weather in Boston. Our supervised learning process includes
multiple safeguards to protect customer privacy. You can manage the use
of your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new
features by visiting *Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data*
in the Alexa app.

Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

How do my voice recordings and text transcripts improve Alexa?*

Alexa is designed to get smarter every day. For example, we use your
requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language
understanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real
world requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa
to respond properly to the variation in our customers’ speech patterns,
dialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where
customers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine
learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely
small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct
interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the
future. For example, a human reviewing a customer’s request for the
weather in Austin can identify that Alexa misinterpreted it as a request
for the weather in Boston. Our supervised learning process includes
multiple safeguards to protect customer privacy. You can manage the use
of your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new
features by visiting *Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data*
in the Alexa app.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Can you delete my voice recordings?
Assistant: Yes, you can delete your voice recordings one by one, by date range, by Alexa-enabled device, or all at once. You can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18 months deleted automatically. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your requests and all of the voice recordings currently in your Voice History as well.

Can you delete my voice recordings?	privacy-FAQ-6	Privacy FAQ	"How do my voice recordings and text transcripts improve Alexa?*

Alexa is designed to get smarter every day. For example, we use your
requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language
understanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real
world requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa
to respond properly to the variation in our customers’ speech patterns,
dialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where
customers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine
learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely
small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct
interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the
future. For example, a human reviewing a customer’s request for the
weather in Austin can identify that Alexa misinterpreted it as a request
for the weather in Boston. Our supervised learning process includes
multiple safeguards to protect customer privacy. You can manage the use
of your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new
features by visiting *Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data*
in the Alexa app.

Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you
choose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.

If you have changed your default marketplace while using an
Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings
associated with your account separately for each marketplace. To learn
how to transfer your Amazon account to another marketplace, go here

Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >
Device Settings in the Alexa app.

we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal
information about you might be shared with third parties and you will
have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

*Transfers out of the European Economic Area:* Whenever we transfer
personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area,
we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this
Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data
protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use
contracts with standard safeguards published by the European Commission
(you can ask Customer Service <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/hz/contact-us>
for a copy of these).

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Are you sharing my age with others?
Assistant: Amazon Europe does not share your personal information, including your age, with others except as described in the privacy notice. This includes sharing with third parties for transactions involving their services, third party service providers, business transfers, and protection of Amazon Europe and others.

Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Who can access information about my appointments?
Assistant: We do not collect or store information about your appointments. The information you can access in your account includes your name, address, payment options, profile information, Prime membership, household settings, and purchase history.

Does the company share user's contacts' information with a third party?	privacy-Notice-5	Privacy Notice	"Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal
information about you might be shared with third parties and you will
have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

*Transfers out of the European Economic Area:* Whenever we transfer
personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area,
we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this
Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data
protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Does the company share user's contacts' information with a third party?
Assistant: Amazon shares customers' personal information only as described in their Privacy Notice. This includes transactions involving third parties, where personal information is shared with the third party for the specific transaction. For example, if you order a product from a third-party seller through Amazon, your personal information would be shared with that seller. Amazon also shares personal information with third-party service providers who perform functions on their behalf. These third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal
information about you might be shared with third parties and you will
have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

*Transfers out of the European Economic Area:* Whenever we transfer
personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area,
we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this
Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data
protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use
contracts with standard safeguards published by the European Commission
(you can ask Customer Service <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/hz/contact-us>

Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal
information about you might be shared with third parties and you will
have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

*Transfers out of the European Economic Area:* Whenever we transfer
personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area,
we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this
Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data
protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use
contracts with standard safeguards published by the European Commission

Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

What About Advertising?

  * *Third-party advertisers and links to other websites:* Amazon
    Services may include third-party advertising and links to other
    websites and apps. Third party advertising partners may collect
    information about you when you interact with their content,
    advertising, and services. For more information about third-party
    advertising at Amazon Europe, including interest-based ads, please
    read our Interest-Based Ads notice
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G64JFZVFDY66XG9K>. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the Advertising Preferences <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/adprefs> page.
  * *Use of third-party advertising services:* We provide ad companies
    with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and
    relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never
    share your name or other information that directly identifies you
    when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a
    cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived from applying
    irreversible cryptography to other information like an email
    address. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our
    apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that
    event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app
    again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you
    relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to
    opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the Advertising
    Preferences <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/adprefs> page.

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Does it save my email contacts and sell it to 3rd parties?
Assistant: Amazon Europe does not sell your personal information to third parties without your consent. However, there are certain situations where your personal information may be disclosed to third parties. For instance, when you order products from third-party sellers through Amazon's stores, your personal information is shared with those sellers to facilitate the transaction. Additionally, Amazon may share your personal information with third-party service providers who perform services on Amazon's behalf. These service providers are required to protect your personal information and are not permitted to use it for any other purpose.

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Does it save my email contacts and sell it to 3rd parties?
Assistant: Amazon Europe does not sell your personal information to third parties without your consent. However, there are certain situations where your personal information may be disclosed to third parties. For instance, when you order products from third-party sellers through Amazon's stores, your personal information is shared with those sellers to facilitate the transaction. Additionally, Amazon may share your personal information with third-party service providers who perform services on Amazon's behalf. These service providers are required to protect your personal information and are not permitted to use it for any other purpose.

Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal
information about you might be shared with third parties and you will
have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

*Transfers out of the European Economic Area:* Whenever we transfer
personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area,
we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this
Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data
protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use
contracts with standard safeguards published by the European Commission
(you can ask Customer Service <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/hz/contact-us>
for a copy of these).

What About Advertising?

  * *Third-party advertisers and links to other websites:* Amazon
    Services may include third-party advertising and links to other
    websites and apps. Third party advertising partners may collect
    information about you when you interact with their content,
    advertising, and services. For more information about third-party
    advertising at Amazon Europe, including interest-based ads, please
    read our Interest-Based Ads notice

  * *Use of third-party advertising services:* We provide ad companies
    with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and
    relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never
    share your name or other information that directly identifies you
    when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a
    cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived from applying
    irreversible cryptography to other information like an email
    address. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our
    apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that
    event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app
    again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you
    relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to
    opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the Advertising

Assistant: Based on the information provided in the sources, Amazon Europe does not sell your personal information, including your email contacts, to third parties for their own use without your consent.

Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal
information about you might be shared with third parties and you will
have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

*Transfers out of the European Economic Area:* Whenever we transfer
personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area,
we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this
Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data
protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use
contracts with standard safeguards published by the European Commission
(you can ask Customer Service <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/hz/contact-us>
for a copy of these).

What About Advertising?

  * *Third-party advertisers and links to other websites:* Amazon
    Services may include third-party advertising and links to other
    websites and apps. Third party advertising partners may collect
    information about you when you interact with their content,
    advertising, and services. For more information about third-party
    advertising at Amazon Europe, including interest-based ads, please
    read our Interest-Based Ads notice
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G64JFZVFDY66XG9K>. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the Advertising Preferences <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/adprefs> page.
  * *Use of third-party advertising services:* We provide ad companies
    with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and
    relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never
    share your name or other information that directly identifies you
    when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a
    cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived from applying
    irreversible cryptography to other information like an email
    address. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our
    apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that
    event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app
    again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you
    relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to
    opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the Advertising
    Preferences <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/adprefs> page.

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Does it save my email contacts and sell it to 3rd parties?
Assistant: Amazon Europe does not sell your personal information to third parties without your consent. However, there are certain situations where your personal information may be disclosed to third parties, such as when you order products from third-party sellers through Amazon's stores, download applications from third-party application providers from Amazon's App Store, or enable third-party skills through Alexa services. In these cases, your personal information is shared with the third party to facilitate the transaction or provide the service. Amazon also uses third-party service providers to perform functions on its behalf, such as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Do you share my location with other people?
Assistant: We do not share your precise location with third parties without your consent, except as necessary to provide you with the services and features you request. For example, if you use the location feature in Alexa to order a ride, we will share your location with the ride service provider to ensure the ride goes to the correct location.

### Source 1 ###
Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal
information about you might be shared with third parties and you will
have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

*Transfers out of the European Economic Area:* Whenever we transfer
personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area,
we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this
Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data
protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use
contracts with standard safeguards published by the European Commission
(you can ask Customer Service <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/hz/contact-us>
for a copy of these).

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Do you share my location with other people?
Assistant: Amazon Europe does not share your precise location with third parties without your consent, except as necessary to provide you with the services and features you request. For example, if you use the location feature in the Alexa app to order a ride, we will share your location with the ride service provider to help them pick you up. We also share location information with third parties if it is aggregated or de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

### Source 1 ###
Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal
information about you might be shared with third parties and you will
have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

*Transfers out of the European Economic Area:* Whenever we transfer
personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area,
we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this
Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data
protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use
contracts with standard safeguards published by the European Commission
(you can ask Customer Service <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/hz/contact-us>
for a copy of these).

Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

  * *Use of third-party advertising services:* We provide ad companies
    with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and
    relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never
    share your name or other information that directly identifies you
    when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a

Assistant: Based on the information provided in Source 1, Amazon Europe shares your name as part of transactions involving third parties and with third-party service providers. However, they only share this information as needed for the specific purpose of the transaction or service."	"You are an assistant who answers questions about data protection. Only the following knowledge is available for answering:

### Source 1 ###
Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal
information about you might be shared with third parties and you will
have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

*Transfers out of the European Economic Area:* Whenever we transfer
personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area,
we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this
Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data
protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use
contracts with standard safeguards published by the European Commission
(you can ask Customer Service <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/hz/contact-us>
for a copy of these).

    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,

    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.

    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Are you sharing my name?
Assistant: Amazon shares customers' personal information only as described in their Privacy Notice. This includes sharing with third parties for transactions involving their services, products, applications, or skills provided on or through Amazon Services. For example, if you order products from third-party sellers through Amazon, your name would be shared with the seller for fulfillment purposes.

Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others.

Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal
information about you might be shared with third parties and you will
have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

*Transfers out of the European Economic Area:* Whenever we transfer
personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area,
we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this
Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data
protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use
contracts with standard safeguards published by the European Commission
(you can ask Customer Service <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/hz/contact-us>

Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal
information about you might be shared with third parties and you will
have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

*Transfers out of the European Economic Area:* Whenever we transfer
personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area,
we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this
Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data
protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use
contracts with standard safeguards published by the European Commission
(you can ask Customer Service <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/hz/contact-us>

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Who has access to my phone number?
Assistant: Your phone number is used to communicate with you about your orders, account activity, and promotional offers. It is also used to enable certain features, such as voice ID for Alexa. Access to your phone number is granted to Amazon employees and contractors who need it to provide and improve these services. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are not authorized to use it for any other purpose.

Assistant: Based on the information provided in the sources, Amazon Europe states that they share customers' personal information only as described in their Privacy Notice.

Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you
choose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.

If you have changed your default marketplace while using an
Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings
associated with your account separately for each marketplace. To learn
how to transfer your Amazon account to another marketplace, go here

### Source 3 ###
Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >
Device Settings in the Alexa app.

Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via

can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you

Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings
associated with your account separately for each marketplace. To learn

Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my

What is the latest privacy policy in regards to processing my voice?	privacy-FAQ-6	Privacy FAQ	"How do my voice recordings and text transcripts improve Alexa?*

Alexa is designed to get smarter every day. For example, we use your
requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language
understanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real
world requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa
to respond properly to the variation in our customers’ speech patterns,
dialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where
customers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine
learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely
small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct
interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the
future. For example, a human reviewing a customer’s request for the
weather in Austin can identify that Alexa misinterpreted it as a request
for the weather in Boston. Our supervised learning process includes
multiple safeguards to protect customer privacy. You can manage the use
of your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new
features by visiting *Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data*
in the Alexa app.

### Source 2 ###
Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >
Device Settings in the Alexa app.

to provide and improve our services and how other Amazon Alexa-enabled
devices and features work, please visit Alexa and Alexa Device FAQs

Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: What is the latest privacy policy in regards to processing my voice?
Assistant: Our privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and share your voice recordings. We use your voice recordings to provide and improve our services and develop new features. We also provide you with control over your voice recordings, including the ability to review, delete, and disable the collection and use of your voice recordings. You can manage your voice recording settings in the Alexa app.

### Source 1 ###
How do my voice recordings and text transcripts improve Alexa?*

Alexa is designed to get smarter every day. For example, we use your
requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language
understanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real
world requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa
to respond properly to the variation in our customers’ speech patterns,
dialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where
customers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine
learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely
small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct
interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the
future. For example, a human reviewing a customer’s request for the
weather in Austin can identify that Alexa misinterpreted it as a request
for the weather in Boston. Our supervised learning process includes
multiple safeguards to protect customer privacy. You can manage the use
of your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new
features by visiting *Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data*
in the Alexa app.

### Source 2 ###
Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >
Device Settings in the Alexa app.

to provide and improve our services and how other Amazon Alexa-enabled
devices and features work, please visit Alexa and Alexa Device FAQs

Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you
choose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.

If you have changed your default marketplace while using an
Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings
associated with your account separately for each marketplace. To learn
how to transfer your Amazon account to another marketplace, go here

How do my voice recordings and text transcripts improve Alexa?*

Alexa is designed to get smarter every day. For example, we use your
requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language
understanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real
world requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa
to respond properly to the variation in our customers’ speech patterns,
dialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where
customers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine
learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely
small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct
interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the
future. For example, a human reviewing a customer’s request for the
weather in Austin can identify that Alexa misinterpreted it as a request
for the weather in Boston. Our supervised learning process includes
multiple safeguards to protect customer privacy. You can manage the use
of your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new
features by visiting *Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data*
in the Alexa app.

### Source 2 ###
Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >
Device Settings in the Alexa app.

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Why do you know my age?
Assistant: We don't have access to your age. The information we collect includes your name, address, payment options, profile information, Prime membership, household settings, and purchase history. We use this information to provide and continually improve our products and services.

Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal
information about you might be shared with third parties and you will
have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

*Transfers out of the European Economic Area:* Whenever we transfer
personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area,
we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this
Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data
protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use
contracts with standard safeguards published by the European Commission
(you can ask Customer Service <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/hz/contact-us>
for a copy of these).

Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal
information about you might be shared with third parties and you will
have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

*Transfers out of the European Economic Area:* Whenever we transfer
personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area,
we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this
Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data
protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use
contracts with standard safeguards published by the European Commission
(you can ask Customer Service <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/hz/contact-us>
for a copy of these).

Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal
information about you might be shared with third parties and you will
have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

*Transfers out of the European Economic Area:* Whenever we transfer
personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area,
we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this
Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data
protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use
contracts with standard safeguards published by the European Commission
(you can ask Customer Service <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/hz/contact-us>
for a copy of these).

Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and
we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal
information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the
subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to
this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
described in this Privacy Notice.

  * *Transactions involving third parties: * We make available to you
    services, products, applications, or skills provided by third
    parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can
    order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download
    applications from third-party application providers from our App
    Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We
    also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party
    businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a
    third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers'
    personal information related to those transactions with that third
    party.
  * *Third party service providers: * We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
    fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages,
    sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from
    customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
    providing search results and links (including paid listings and
    links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and
    managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These
    third-party service providers have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
    purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in
    accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable
    data protection laws.
  * *Business transfers:* As we continue to develop our business, we
    might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such
    transactions, customer information generally is one of the
    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
    in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
    consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com,
    Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * *Protection of Amazon Europe and others: * We release account and
    other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
    comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use
    <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal
information about you might be shared with third parties and you will
have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

*Transfers out of the European Economic Area:* Whenever we transfer
personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area,
we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this
Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data
protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use
contracts with standard safeguards published by the European Commission
(you can ask Customer Service <https://www.amazon.de/-/en/hz/contact-us>
for a copy of these).

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Why did you add all my contacts' phone numbers to my contact book?
Assistant: We do not add your contacts' phone numbers to your contact book without your consent. However, if you have given us permission to access your contacts, we may suggest phone numbers to you as potential matches for voice ID or for contact suggestions. We do not store your contacts' phone numbers unless you add them to your own contact book.

Assistant: We do not automatically import your contacts' phone numbers to your contact book. However, if you choose to use certain features, such as the Alexa Calling and Messaging feature, you can add contacts by giving us their names or phone numbers. We process this information to enable and improve these features.

Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Why do you know my location?
Assistant: We use your location to provide and improve our services. For example, we use your location to determine the delivery address for your orders, to provide location-based services, and to personalize your shopping experience. We may also use location information to help protect against fraud or to provide customer support.

Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Do you need to know my time zone?
Assistant: Yes, knowing your time zone helps us to deliver information and services relevant to your location. For example, it allows us to provide you with local weather updates, news, and promotions.

Why do you record my voice?	privacy-FAQ-1	Privacy FAQ	"Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

### Source 2 ###
Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >
Device Settings in the Alexa app.

to provide and improve our services and how other Amazon Alexa-enabled
devices and features work, please visit Alexa and Alexa Device FAQs

How do my voice recordings and text transcripts improve Alexa?*

Alexa is designed to get smarter every day. For example, we use your
requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language
understanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real
world requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa
to respond properly to the variation in our customers’ speech patterns,
dialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where
customers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine
learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely
small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct
interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the
future. For example, a human reviewing a customer’s request for the
weather in Austin can identify that Alexa misinterpreted it as a request
for the weather in Boston. Our supervised learning process includes
multiple safeguards to protect customer privacy. You can manage the use
of your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new
features by visiting *Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data*
in the Alexa app.

### Source 1 ###
Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

*

### Source 2 ###
Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >
Device Settings in the Alexa app.

How do my voice recordings and text transcripts improve Alexa?*

Alexa is designed to get smarter every day. For example, we use your
requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language
understanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real
world requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa
to respond properly to the variation in our customers’ speech patterns,
dialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where
customers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine
learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely
small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct
interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the
future. For example, a human reviewing a customer’s request for the
weather in Austin can identify that Alexa misinterpreted it as a request
for the weather in Boston. Our supervised learning process includes
multiple safeguards to protect customer privacy. You can manage the use
of your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new
features by visiting *Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data*
in the Alexa app.

Assistant: We record your voice to provide and improve our services. For example, we use your voice recordings to recognize your voice and respond to your requests. We also use your voice recordings to train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems using machine learning. This helps Alexa understand and respond to a wide range of customer requests and improve over time.
"	"You are an assistant who answers questions about data protection. Only the following knowledge is available for answering:

-----------

### Source 1 ###
Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

*

### Source 2 ###
Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >
Device Settings in the Alexa app.

How do my voice recordings and text transcripts improve Alexa?*

Alexa is designed to get smarter every day. For example, we use your
requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language
understanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real
world requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa
to respond properly to the variation in our customers’ speech patterns,
dialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where
customers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine
learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely
small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct
interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the
future. For example, a human reviewing a customer’s request for the
weather in Austin can identify that Alexa misinterpreted it as a request
for the weather in Boston. Our supervised learning process includes
multiple safeguards to protect customer privacy. You can manage the use
of your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new
features by visiting *Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data*
in the Alexa app.

Why do you record my voice?
Assistant: Based on the information provided in the sources, Alexa records voice data to provide and improve its services.

Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

Human: Does the assistant have access to my contacts?
Assistant: No, by default, Alexa does not have access to your contacts. However, you can give Alexa permission to access your contacts in your device's settings, and then Alexa can use your contacts to help you make calls or send messages using the Drop In and Announcements features.

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Does the assistant have access to my contacts?
Assistant: No, by default, Alexa does not have access to your contacts. However, you can give Alexa permission to access your contacts in your device's settings, and then Alexa can use your contacts to help you make calls or send messages using the Drop In and Announcements features.

### Source 2 ###
Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

How do you process my audio recordings?	privacy-FAQ-6	Privacy FAQ	"How do my voice recordings and text transcripts improve Alexa?*

Alexa is designed to get smarter every day. For example, we use your
requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language
understanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real
world requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa
to respond properly to the variation in our customers’ speech patterns,
dialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where
customers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine
learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely
small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct
interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the
future. For example, a human reviewing a customer’s request for the
weather in Austin can identify that Alexa misinterpreted it as a request
for the weather in Boston. Our supervised learning process includes
multiple safeguards to protect customer privacy. You can manage the use
of your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new
features by visiting *Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data*
in the Alexa app.

Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you
choose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.

If you have changed your default marketplace while using an
Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings
associated with your account separately for each marketplace. To learn
how to transfer your Amazon account to another marketplace, go here

respond to you. For example, when you ask, ""Alexa, play top hits on
Amazon Music,"" we use the recording of your request and information from

What happens when I speak to Alexa?*

When you speak to Alexa, a recording of what you asked Alexa is sent to
Amazon's cloud, where we process your request and other information to
respond to you. For example, when you ask, ""Alexa, play top hits on
Amazon Music,"" we use the recording of your request and information from
Amazon Music to play top hits.

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: How do you process my audio recordings?
Assistant: When you speak to Alexa, a recording of what you asked Alexa is sent to Amazon's cloud, where we process your request and other information to respond to you. For example, when you ask, ""Alexa, play top hits on Amazon Music,"" we use the recording of your request and information from Amazon Music to play top hits. We also use your recordings to improve Alexa's speech recognition and natural language understanding systems using machine learning. This training relies in part on supervised machine learning, where humans review an extremely small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the future.

How do my voice recordings and text transcripts improve Alexa?*

Alexa is designed to get smarter every day. For example, we use your
requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language
understanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real
world requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa
to respond properly to the variation in our customers’ speech patterns,
dialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where
customers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine
learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely
small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct
interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the
future. For example, a human reviewing a customer’s request for the
weather in Austin can identify that Alexa misinterpreted it as a request
for the weather in Boston. Our supervised learning process includes
multiple safeguards to protect customer privacy. You can manage the use
of your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new
features by visiting *Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data*

Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you
choose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.

If you have changed your default marketplace while using an
Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings
associated with your account separately for each marketplace. To learn
how to transfer your Amazon account to another marketplace, go here

What happens when I speak to Alexa?*

When you speak to Alexa, a recording of what you asked Alexa is sent to
Amazon's cloud, where we process your request and other information to
respond to you. For example, when you ask, ""Alexa, play top hits on
Amazon Music,"" we use the recording of your request and information from
Amazon Music to play top hits.

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: How do you process my audio recordings?
Assistant: When you speak to Alexa, a recording of what you asked Alexa is sent to Amazon's cloud, where we process your request and other information to respond to you. For example, when you ask, ""Alexa, play top hits on Amazon Music,"" we use the recording of your request and information from Amazon Music to play top hits. We also use your recordings to improve Alexa's speech recognition and natural language understanding systems using machine learning. This training relies in part on supervised machine learning, where humans review an extremely small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the future.

### Source 2 ###
Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those

Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to

*"	"You are an assistant who answers questions about data protection. Only the following knowledge is available for answering:

-----------

### Source 1 ###
Can I turn off the microphones on Echo devices?*

Yes. Echo devices are equipped with a microphone off button. When the
button is pressed, the power to the microphones is disconnected and a
dedicated red light is illuminated. When the microphones are turned off,
your device cannot record and stream audio to the cloud, even when you
say your chosen wake word.

*

### Source 2 ###
Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

*

### Source 3 ###
Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you

wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >

Conversation between a human and an assistant.

Human: For what purpose is my name collected?
Assistant: We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.
Human: Is my calendar stored on the device?
Assistant: By default, Alexa does not access or store your calendar data on your device. However, you can allow Alexa to access your calendar data in the cloud, such as from Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar, so that Alexa can provide you with calendar information, such as upcoming appointments and events.

Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you
choose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.

If you have changed your default marketplace while using an
Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings
associated with your account separately for each marketplace. To learn
how to transfer your Amazon account to another marketplace, go here

Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >
Device Settings in the Alexa app.

to provide and improve our services and how other Amazon Alexa-enabled
devices and features work, please visit Alexa and Alexa Device FAQs

How long will my location history be kept?	privacy-FAQ-5	Privacy FAQ	"Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you
choose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.

If you have changed your default marketplace while using an
Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings
associated with your account separately for each marketplace. To learn
how to transfer your Amazon account to another marketplace, go here

Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >

How long will my location history be kept?
Assistant: I cannot directly answer that question as the provided sources do not mention anything about location history. However, they do discuss how long personal information and voice recordings are kept."	"You are an assistant who answers questions about data protection. Only the following knowledge is available for answering:

-----------

### Source 1 ###
How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Information?

We keep your personal information to enable your continued use of Amazon
Services, for as long as it is required in order to fulfil the relevant
purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required by law
such as for tax and accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to
you. For example, we retain your transaction history so that you can
review past purchases (and repeat orders if desired) and what addresses
you have shipped orders to, and to improve the relevancy of products and
content we recommend.

### Source 2 ###
Can I review and delete my voice recordings?*

Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and
delete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by
Alexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa
Privacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,
you can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18
months deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice
recordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will
automatically delete your voice recordings after we process your
requests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently
in your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice
recordings associated with your account all at once for each of your
Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and
Devices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.

You can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If
enabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by
saying “Alexa, delete what I just said,” delete the voice recordings
associated with your account for the day by saying ""Alexa, delete
everything I said today,"" or all the voice recordings associated with
your account by saying, “Alexa, delete everything I said.” Deletion by
voice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has
created an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting
to delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not
created an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings
> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or
https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting
<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via
your Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices
can ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.

Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you
choose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.

If you have changed your default marketplace while using an
Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings
associated with your account separately for each marketplace. To learn
how to transfer your Amazon account to another marketplace, go here

Can I choose not to send my voice recordings to the cloud?*

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the
weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud.

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can
respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those
transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you
create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice
will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
Alexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How
does Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my
Alexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more
information.

If you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language
Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for
you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s
ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use
Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to
English (United States). If you change your device language to anything
other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send
Voice Recordings.

You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >
Device Settings in the Alexa app.

How do my voice recordings and text transcripts improve Alexa?*

Alexa is designed to get smarter every day. For example, we use your
requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language
understanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real
world requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa
to respond properly to the variation in our customers’ speech patterns,
dialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where
customers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine
learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely
small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct
interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the
future. For example, a human reviewing a customer’s request for the
weather in Austin can identify that Alexa misinterpreted it as a request
for the weather in Boston. Our supervised learning process includes
multiple safeguards to protect customer privacy. You can manage the use
of your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new
features by visiting *Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data*
in the Alexa app.

### Source 3 ###
Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

How do my voice recordings and text transcripts improve Alexa?*

Alexa is designed to get smarter every day. For example, we use your
requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language
understanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real
world requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa
to respond properly to the variation in our customers’ speech patterns,
dialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where
customers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine
learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely
small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct
interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the
future. For example, a human reviewing a customer’s request for the
weather in Austin can identify that Alexa misinterpreted it as a request
for the weather in Boston. Our supervised learning process includes
multiple safeguards to protect customer privacy. You can manage the use
of your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new
features by visiting *Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data*
in the Alexa app.

### Source 3 ###
Is Alexa recording all my conversations?*

No. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen
wake word (e.g., Alexa, Ziggy, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device
detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the
wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device
detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). On
certain devices, you can enable features that allow you to interact with
Alexa without the wake word. For instance, Follow Up Mode allows you to
make follow-up requests to Alexa without having to repeat the wake word.
You can also configure supported Echo devices to detect specific sounds,
such as the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and glass
breaking.

Do you store my voice recordings locally or on a server?
Assistant: Based on the information provided in the sources, Alexa processes some voice recordings locally on your device, but others are sent to the cloud. The text transcripts of your requests are also stored in the cloud. This is done to enable features like Dynamic Language Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick, and to improve Alexa's speech recognition and natural language understanding systems. However, you can choose to turn on 'Do Not Send Voice Recordings' in the Alexa app to prevent your voice recordings from being sent to the cloud.

On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so
the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the

A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can

transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the
cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when
you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you

will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if
you enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the
