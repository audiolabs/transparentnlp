You can do this by logging into your Amazon account and visiting the \"Your Account\" section. From there, you can edit your personal information, including your name.

From either page,\nyou can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18\nmonths deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice\nrecordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will\nautomatically delete your voice recordings after we process your\nrequests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently\nin your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice\nrecordings associated with your account all at once for each of your\nAlexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and\nDevices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.\n\nYou can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If\nenabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by\nsaying \u201cAlexa, delete what I just said,\u201d delete the voice recordings\nassociated with your account for the day by saying \"Alexa, delete\neverything I said today,\" or all the voice recordings associated with\nyour account by saying, \u201cAlexa, delete everything I said.\u201d Deletion by\nvoice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has\ncreated an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting\nto delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not\ncreated an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings\n> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or\nhttps://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting\n<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via\nyour Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices\ncan ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.\n\nDeleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you\nchoose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.\n\nIf you have changed your default marketplace while using an\nAlexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings\nassociated with your account separately for each marketplace.

You will be able to review and delete those\ntranscripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the\ncloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when\nyou make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you\ncreate a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice\nwill be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if\nyou enable Alexa Emergency Assist, including for Smart Alerts. See *the\nAlexa Communication FAQs* and the FAQs *How does voice ID work?, How\ndoes Alexa Emergency Assist work?,* *and Can I review and delete my\nAlexa Guard or Alexa Emergency Assist audio recordings?* for more\ninformation.\n\nIf you turn this setting on, certain features like Dynamic Language\nSwitching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for\nyou. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa\u2019s\nability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use\nDo Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to\nEnglish (United States). If you change your device language to anything\nother than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send\nVoice Recordings.\n\nYou can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings >\nDevice Settings in the Alexa app.\n\nFor more commonly asked questions, including how we use voice recordings\nto provide and improve our services and how other Amazon Alexa-enabled\ndevices and features work, please visit Alexa and Alexa Device FAQs\n<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201602230>.\n\nTo learn more about how Amazon protects your privacy, visit\namazon.com/alexaprivacy.\n\n\n*\n\n### Source 3 ###\nHow do my voice recordings and text transcripts improve Alexa?*\n\nAlexa is designed to get smarter every day. For example, we use your\nrequests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language\nunderstanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real\nworld requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa\nto respond properly to the variation in our customers\u2019 speech patterns,\ndialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where\ncustomers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine\nlearning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely\nsmall sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct\ninterpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the\nfuture. For example, a human reviewing a customer\u2019s request for the\nweather in Austin can identify that Alexa misinterpreted it as a request\nfor the weather in Boston. Our supervised learning process includes\nmultiple safeguards to protect customer privacy. You can manage the use\nof your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new\nfeatures by visiting *Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data*\nin the Alexa app.\n\n*\n\n-----------\n\nDo not use knowledge that does not appear in the sources. Not all sources need to be used.\n\n\nCan you delete my voice recordings?\nAssistant: Yes, you can delete your voice recordings by visiting Settings > Alexa Privacy in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings. You can delete voice recordings one by one, by date range, by Alexa-enabled device, or all at once. You can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18 months deleted automatically. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, they will be deleted after processing your requests. You can also delete all voice recordings associated with your account for each of your Alexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and Devices. You can also delete voice recordings by voice command if you have enabled the ability to delete your recordings by voice. Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience if you choose not to save any voice recordings. If you have changed your default marketplace while using an Alexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings associated with your account separately for each marketplace."}, {"question": "Are you sharing my age with others?", "documents": [{"id": "privacy-Notice-5", "title": "Privacy Notice", "content": "Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?\n\nInformation about our customers is an important part of our business and\nwe are not in the business of selling our customers\u2019 personal\ninformation to others.

For example, we use your\nrequests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language\nunderstanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real\nworld requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa\nto respond properly to the variation in our customers\u2019 speech patterns,\ndialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where\ncustomers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine\nlearning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely\nsmall sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct\ninterpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the\nfuture.

For example, we use your\nrequests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language\nunderstanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real\nworld requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa\nto respond properly to the variation in our customers\u2019 speech patterns,\ndialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where\ncustomers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine\nlearning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely\nsmall sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct\ninterpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the\nfuture. For example, a human reviewing a customer\u2019s request for the\nweather in Austin can identify that Alexa misinterpreted it as a request\nfor the weather in Boston. Our supervised learning process includes\nmultiple safeguards to protect customer privacy. You can manage the use\nof your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new\nfeatures by visiting *Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data*\nin the Alexa app.\n\n*\n\n-----------\n\nDo not use knowledge that does not appear in the sources.

You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa's ability to recognize you.\nHuman: Why do you record my voice?\nAssistant: We record your voice to provide and improve our services. For example, we use your voice recordings to recognize your voice and respond to your requests. We also use your voice recordings to train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems using machine learning.

For example, when you ask, \"Alexa, play top hits on Amazon Music,\" we use the recording of your request and information from Amazon Music to play top hits. We also use your recordings to improve Alexa's speech recognition and natural language understanding systems using machine learning. This training relies in part on supervised machine learning, where humans review an extremely small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the future.\n", "pa": "You are an assistant who answers questions about data protection. Only the following knowledge is available for answering:\n\n-----------\n\n### Source 1 ###\nHow do my voice recordings and text transcripts improve Alexa?*\n\nAlexa is designed to get smarter every day. For example, we use your\nrequests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language\nunderstanding systems using machine learning. Training Alexa with real\nworld requests from a diverse range of customers is necessary for Alexa\nto respond properly to the variation in our customers\u2019 speech patterns,\ndialects, accents, and vocabulary and the acoustic environments where\ncustomers use Alexa. This training relies in part on supervised machine\nlearning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely\nsmall sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct\ninterpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the\nfuture. For example, a human reviewing a customer\u2019s request for the\nweather in Austin can identify that Alexa misinterpreted it as a request\nfor the weather in Boston. Our supervised learning process includes\nmultiple safeguards to protect customer privacy. You can manage the use\nof your voice recordings to improve our services and develop new\nfeatures by visiting *Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data*\nin the Alexa app.\n\n*\n\n### Source 2 ###\nCan I review and delete my voice recordings?*\n\nYes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and\ndelete those voice recordings one by one, by date range, by\nAlexa-enabled device, or all at once by visiting *Settings > Alexa\nPrivacy* in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings\n<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. From either page,\nyou can also choose to have your voice recordings older than 3 or 18\nmonths deleted automatically, or you can choose to not save any voice\nrecordings. If you choose not to save any voice recordings, we will\nautomatically delete your voice recordings after we process your\nrequests and automatically delete all of the voice recordings currently\nin your Voice History as well. And you can delete all those voice\nrecordings associated with your account all at once for each of your\nAlexa-enabled devices and apps by visiting Manage Your Content and\nDevices <https://www.amazon.com/-/de/mycd>.\n\nYou can also enable the ability to delete your recordings by voice. If\nenabled, you can delete the voice recording of your last request by\nsaying \u201cAlexa, delete what I just said,\u201d delete the voice recordings\nassociated with your account for the day by saying \"Alexa, delete\neverything I said today,\" or all the voice recordings associated with\nyour account by saying, \u201cAlexa, delete everything I said.\u201d Deletion by\nvoice is automatically enabled if any member of your household has\ncreated an Alexa voice ID and their voice is recognized when requesting\nto delete recordings by voice. If you or your household members have not\ncreated an Alexa voice ID, you can enable deletion by voice at *Settings\n> Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data* in the Alexa app, or\nhttps://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysetting\n<https://www.amazon.com/-/de/alexaprivacysettings>. When enabled via\nyour Privacy Settings, anyone with access to your Alexa-enabled devices\ncan ask Alexa to delete voice recordings associated with your account.\n\nDeleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you\nchoose not to save any voice recordings, voice ID may not work.\n\nIf you have changed your default marketplace while using an\nAlexa-enabled product, you will need to delete all voice recordings\nassociated with your account separately for each marketplace.

For example, when you ask, \"Alexa, play top hits on\nAmazon Music,\" we use the recording of your request and information from\nAmazon Music to play top hits.\n\n*\n\n-----------\n\nDo not use knowledge that does not appear in the sources. Not all sources need to be used.\n\n\nHow do you process my audio recordings?\nAssistant: Based on the information provided in the sources, when you speak to Alexa, your audio recording is sent to Amazon's cloud where it is processed to understand your request and provide the appropriate response. This process involves using machine learning algorithms to improve Alexa's speech recognition and natural language understanding systems. However, human review is also involved in a small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the future. You can manage the use of your voice recordings to improve Alexa's services and develop new features by visiting the Alexa app's privacy settings. You can also review, delete, or disable the saving of your voice recordings."}, {"question": "Does the assistant turn on my mic without my knowledge?", "documents": [{"id": "privacy-FAQ-4", "title": "Privacy FAQ", "content": "Can I turn off the microphones on Echo devices?*\n\nYes.
