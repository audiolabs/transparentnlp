What do you need my phone number for?	On certain Alexa-enabled products (like Echo Auto), Alexa connects to your phone and allows you to send and receive calls and messages via Alexa using your existing phone service and talk/text plan. When you ask Alexa to place a call or message, Alexa will use Alexa Communication to complete those requests if possible. However, if the recipient is not another Alexa Communication user, or you wish to contact a specific phone number, Alexa can use your existing phone service to place that call or message (features may vary by device and operating system). Alexa may not be able to process your request in the event of network or connectivity issues. If you are unable to place your call via Alexa, you should dial the number directly from your phone.	0.	0.

By default, Alexa-enabled devices only stream audio to the cloud if the wake word is detected (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). When an Alexa-enabled device detects the wake word and begins streaming audio to the cloud, Alexa performs a ""cloud verification"" of the wake word using the more powerful processing capabilities of the cloud to double-check the audio to confirm detection of the wake word. If the cloud verification does not also detect the wake word, Alexa stops processing the audio and ends the audio stream to the cloud. If Alexa confirms that the wake word was spoken, Alexa will continually attempt to determine when your request has ended and then immediately end the audio stream."	0	0.	90 (This score is given assuming that the Alexa App does have a help and feedback section.

We have a team of world-class scientists and engineers dedicated to continually improving our wake word detection technology and preventing false wakes from happening, including through the cloud verification mechanism described in the FAQ ""How does Alexa minimize the amount of data sent to the cloud?"" Anytime your Echo device detects the wake word, a visual or audible indicator will signal it is recording audio to stream to the cloud, and you can review and delete the voice recordings associated with your account (including any audio resulting from a false wake) in your Voice History available in the Alexa app and Echo Show devices at Settings > Alexa Privacy or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings."

Do you store my voice recordings locally or on a server?	On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud. A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if you enable Alexa Guard, including for Smart Alerts and emergency calling with Guard Plus. See the Alexa Communication FAQs and the FAQs How does voice ID work?, How does Alexa Guard work?, and Can I review and delete my Alexa Guard audio recordings? for more information. If you turn this setting on, certain features like Live Translations, Dynamic Language Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to English (United States). If you change your device language to anything other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send Voice Recordings. You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings > Device Settings in the Alexa app.	NA	0	NA	0	50	60	50.	50.	90.	90	100	40.	70.	90.	90	90	60	NA	90. The answer is highly relevant to the question, but it includes some additional information that is not directly relevant.	90	100.	70.	95.	90.	90	100.	60	90	90.	90	100.	60	90	90.	90	60	50	100.	90.	90	85.	60.	100	95. The score is not a perfect 100 because while the answer is highly relevant, it could have been more direct in stating that both local and server storage are used, depending on the settings and features used.	90	85.	50	100.	90.	90	90	60	100.	90.	90
