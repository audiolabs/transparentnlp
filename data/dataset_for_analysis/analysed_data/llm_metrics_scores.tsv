Do you store my voice recordings locally or on a server?	On supported devices, you can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings, so the audio of your requests to Alexa (for example, “Alexa, what’s the weather?”) will be processed on device and not sent to the cloud. A text transcript of your request will be sent to the cloud so Alexa can respond to your request. You will be able to review and delete those transcripts in your Voice History. Alexa will still send audio to the cloud for features that require the transmission of audio, such as when you make a call or send a message or announcement via Alexa. And, if you create a voice ID, the audio recordings used to teach Alexa your voice will be sent to the cloud. Alexa will also send audio to the cloud if you enable Alexa Guard, including for Smart Alerts and emergency calling with Guard Plus. See the Alexa Communication FAQs and the FAQs How does voice ID work?, How does Alexa Guard work?, and Can I review and delete my Alexa Guard audio recordings? for more information. If you turn this setting on, certain features like Live Translations, Dynamic Language Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick will not work for you. If you have a voice ID, turning this setting on may affect Alexa’s ability to recognize your voice and personalize your experiences. To use Do Not Send Voice Recordings, your device language must be set to English (United States). If you change your device language to anything other than English (United States), Alexa will turn off Do Not Send Voice Recordings. You can turn on Do Not Send Voice Recordings by visiting Settings > Device Settings in the Alexa app.	NA	0.

For what purpose is my name collected?	We use your personal information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the products and services that we offer our customers. You can create a voice ID, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When you create a voice ID, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics and to update that model over time to improve Alexa’s ability to recognize you.

How can you guarantee my location information is secure?	We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind. We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of customer personal information. Our security procedures mean that we may ask to verify your identity before we disclose personal information to you. Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs. Click here for more information on how to manage the security settings of your device. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers, devices, and applications. We recommend using a unique password for your Amazon account that is not used for other online accounts. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

How do you process my audio recordings?	"Alexa and Echo devices are designed to record as little audio as possible and minimize the amount of background noise streamed to the cloud. By default, Alexa-enabled devices only stream audio to the cloud if the wake word is detected (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). When an Alexa-enabled device detects the wake word and begins streaming audio to the cloud, Alexa performs a ""cloud verification"" of the wake word using the more powerful processing capabilities of the cloud to double-check the audio to confirm detection of the wake word. If the cloud verification does not also detect the wake word, Alexa stops processing the audio and ends the audio stream to the cloud. If Alexa confirms that the wake word was spoken, Alexa will continually attempt to determine when your request has ended and then immediately end the audio stream."	0	0	90 (This score is given on the assumption that the Alexa App does have a help and feedback section.

What do you need my phone number for?	On certain Alexa-enabled products (like Echo Auto), Alexa connects to your phone and allows you to send and receive calls and messages via Alexa using your existing phone service and talk/text plan. When you ask Alexa to place a call or message, Alexa will use Alexa Communication to complete those requests if possible. However, if the recipient is not another Alexa Communication user, or you wish to contact a specific phone number, Alexa can use your existing phone service to place that call or message (features may vary by device and operating system). Alexa may not be able to process your request in the event of network or connectivity issues. If you are unable to place your call via Alexa, you should dial the number directly from your phone.	0	0	NA	0	100	70	60	80.	85.	95	40	60	50.	75.	95	10	30	NA	90.	95	0	0.	NA	90.	100	30	0.	90.

Why do you record my voice?	"Alexa uses your voice recordings and other information, including from third-party services, to answer your questions, fulfill your requests, and improve your experience and our services. We associate your requests with your Amazon account to allow you to review your voice recordings, access other Amazon services (e.g. so you can ask Alexa to read your Kindle books and play audiobooks from Audible), and to provide you with a more personalized experience. For example, keeping track of the songs you have listened to helps Alexa choose what songs to play when you say, ""Alexa, play music."" At times, Alexa can provide you with recommendations based on your requests. For example, Alexa may recommend Alexa skills you might like based on the Alexa skills you use."	60.	60	100.	85.	90	60	60.	100.	85.	90	60	30.	90.	100.	100	60.	70.	90.	95.	85	70.	60	80.	100.	90	80.	50.	95.	100.	95	85.	60.	95.	100.	90	60.	60.	90	85.	90	60	60.	90.	100.	90	70	60.	90.

The score is not a perfect 100 because we don't have specific sources to verify the information, but it's high because the information is consistent with general knowledge about voice-activated services.	90.	90	75.	70.	90.	100	90
Why is all my contacts' personal information needed?	"You can use supported Echo devices and the Alexa app to place outbound calls to up to ten phone numbers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom for free (e.g., on Echo, ""Alexa, call Mom's mobile phone."") If you are already an Alexa Communication user, no additional set up is required - you can start making calls straight away. As you place calls to phone numbers, Alexa will automatically add up to ten contacts to your Alexa-to-phone contacts list. You can manage this list in the Alexa app by visiting Settings > Communication > Manage Contacts. If you are not an Alexa Communication user, you will first need to register for Alexa Communication."	0	0	NA	30.	100	30	40.	100.	70.	95	20	20.	90	70.	90	30	60.	90.	85.	90	20.	0	90.
