"Alexa and Echo devices are designed to record as little audio as possible and minimize the amount of background noise streamed to the cloud. By default, Alexa-enabled devices only stream audio to the cloud if the wake word is detected (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button). When an Alexa-enabled device detects the wake word and begins streaming audio to the cloud, Alexa performs a ""cloud verification"" of the wake word using the more powerful processing capabilities of the cloud to double-check the audio to confirm detection of the wake word. If the cloud verification does not also detect the wake word, Alexa stops processing the audio and ends the audio stream to the cloud. If Alexa confirms that the wake word was spoken, Alexa will continually attempt to determine when your request has ended and then immediately end the audio stream."

When this happens, we call that a ""false wake."" We have a team of world-class scientists and engineers dedicated to continually improving our wake word detection technology and preventing false wakes from happening, including through the cloud verification mechanism described in the FAQ ""How does Alexa minimize the amount of data sent to the cloud?"" Anytime your Echo device detects the wake word, a visual or audible indicator will signal it is recording audio to stream to the cloud, and you can review and delete the voice recordings associated with your account (including any audio resulting from a false wake) in your Voice History available in the Alexa app and Echo Show devices at Settings > Alexa Privacy or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings."
