do you store my voice recordings locally or on a server?,"Based on the information provided in the sources, Alexa processes some voice recordings locally on your device, but others are sent to the cloud. The text transcripts of your requests are also stored in the cloud. This is done to enable features like Dynamic Language Switching, Adaptive Listening, and Reading Sidekick, and to improve Alexa's speech recognition and natural language understanding systems. However, you can choose to turn on 'Do Not Send Voice Recordings' in the Alexa app to prevent your voice recordings from being sent to the cloud.
