## Data Processing Directory Overview
This directory contains two main scripts:

1. json_to_tsv_processing.py
2. merge_tsv_files_for_evaluation.py


## Script Descriptions

### json_to_tsv_processing.py:
This script guides the user through a step-by-step process to convert a JSON file into a TSV format:

Step 1: Enter the path to the data directory.
Step 2: Enter the name of the JSON file (omit res_ and .json).
Step 3: Enter the desired name for the output TSV file (include .tsv).


Example Input:

Path to data directory: correctness_readability
JSON file name (without prefix or extension): correctness
Output TSV file name: my_data_on_correctness.tsv

The TSV output will be saved in the directory specified in the first step. You
will also see a progress bar, so be patient. 

### merge_tsv_files_for_evaluation.py:

This script consolidates all TSV files within the specified directory, 
retaining only columns required for further analysis. You donâ€™t need 
to modify or filter columns manually, as the script automatically 
selects the necessary ones for evaluation in subsequent steps.
